1. -describe break mechanism for location occupied by other agents-

2. Create a trigger collider around the agent that detects obstacles whenever one enter the collider. Then create a path around the obstacle via an offset calculated with the distance between the obstacle and the agent.

3. When the carving option is not enabled for a NavMeshAgent, the obstacle becomes little more than a collider. The NavMeshAgents display basic avoidance behavior and may become stuck if they are in an environment filled with NavMeshObstacles. When the carving option is enabled for a NavMeshObstacle, the obstacle carves a hole into the NavMesh. This means the NavMeshAgents are able to recalculate their paths if their path becomes blocked and can find their way through rooms filled with NavMeshObstacles easier. 
The carve checkbox should be activated for obstacles that will remain static in the environment and unchecked for obstacles that move.
If all obstacles were carving ...
If all obstacles weren't carving, agents might become stuck if there are too many obstacles.
